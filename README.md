This is still very much a WIP. I'll be adding to the pages and improving the look of the site over time, but it's not a priority. Half the reason I'm making this is to keep me practising HTML/CSS (practice is most of this GitHub, let's be honest), but I may end up using it for other stuff eventually.

For now, I guess you can take a look around at what is here (not that there's much yet).
