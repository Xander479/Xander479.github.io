Hey there, I don't have a real idea of what I want to do with this site yet but if you want to check out my projects, feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/Xander479">GitHub</a> or use the navigation to the left.

I've enjoyed getting "behind the scenes" ever since I was first shown HTML/CSS at school. From there I dabbled in JavaScript and C, but these days my main focus is in Java. I'm currently studying in my own time to develop my skills and intend to work full time as in software development. Even when I'm not doing serious work, I love learning about how things work under the hood so I've been known to use assembly to write patches modifying Super Mario World.

Speaking of Super Mario World, in my spare time I often stream speedruns of the game on Twitch. I've been running the game for around 4 years and am constantly working at improving my times.
