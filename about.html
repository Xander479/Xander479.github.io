<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I've enjoyed getting "behind the scenes" ever since I was first shown HTML/CSS at school. From there I dabbled in JavaScript and C, but my main language now is Java. These days, I study in my own time to develop my skills with the intent of working in software development full time. Even when not doing serious work, I enjoy writing patches for Super Mario World in assembly because I still love learning how things work under the hood.

Speaking of Super Mario World, in my spare time I often stream speedruns of the game on Twitch. I mainly focus on what is essentially the game's 100% category and keep working at bringing my times down.
